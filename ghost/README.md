# Ghost

**Ghost** is an open source headless Node.js CMS, a blogging platform. The web application will be containerised by Docker, be composed by `docker-compose` associating with other essential services (database, web server and SSL) and be ready to serve on an IaaS cloud machine.

## Logistics

1. Create a VM with image Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04.

2. Add inbound ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) in the security groups.
